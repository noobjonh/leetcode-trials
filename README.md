my leetcode solutions

hello i am a newly minted programmer who has been on and off for a while but now things are going to change
my goal is to be hired at a very good firm or have a good carrer where i do something that i like everyday which is to do with programming, computer security and computer science in general.
i know how to code in python,javascript and c but i will learn more
These are the solutions that i came up with for the leetcode problems that i encountered.
I will also do some more projects to sharpen my skills.
